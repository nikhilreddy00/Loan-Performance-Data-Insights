# 🏡 Loan Performance Data Insights  
📊 **Big Data & AI for Mortgage Loan Risk Analysis**  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
Dive into the **Fannie Mae Single-Family Loan Performance Dataset** to uncover the dynamics of mortgage performance over time. By harnessing **Big Data processing & Machine Learning**, we delve into **loan delinquency trends, default risks, and borrower credit behavior**.  

### 🔹 **Our Goals**  
✔ Identify **delinquency & default patterns** 🔍  
✔ Assess **credit score impact on loan risk** 💳  
✔ Predict **high-risk loans using ML models** 🤖  
✔ Evaluate **loan recovery post-foreclosure** 💰  

📆 **Data Coverage**: 2000 - 2023 (Updated Quarterly)
